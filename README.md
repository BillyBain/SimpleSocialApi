# Test Instructions
Using the URLs like `http://localhost:3001/api/users` and `http://localhost:3001/api/thoughts` with the `GET` method you can see the seeded data. You can `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE` using these routes some with `/:id` after. If you would like to add a reaction use the `http://localhost:3001/api/thoughts/:id/reaction` route with the `POST` method. To delete using the `DELETE` method add the `reactionId` to the end of the previous route.

# Thoughts
I enjoy the NoSQL system and this has helped me understand databases at a higher capacities. I struggled a bit with linking the databases and was glad when i finally saw the reactions on the thoughts.
